## Project

This project is being created for Franklin University's Spring 2026 capstone courses (COMP 294, COMP 394, and COMP 495). Our goal is to make a fully functioning web application that can be used for creating, editing, and managing hotel reservations.

### Project Name
Hotel Prosper

### Project Description  
Hotel Prosper is a web-based hotel reservation management application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete reservations, as well as manage their account information. The project will be built using ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages and will use GitHub for version control and team collaboration. The goal is to develop a practical, user-friendly CRUD web application while gaining hands-on experience with ASP.NET Core and collaborative development.
